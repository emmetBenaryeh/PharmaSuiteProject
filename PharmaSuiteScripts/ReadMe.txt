This software is the result of many many hours of tinkering with petty changes and adjusting directory setups, it is a labor of love and the product of my blood,sweat,tears, and close to 40 hrs of work. As such it is a mess and it does not like to run on systems other than my own. I have no clue how to make this run on mac or linux but if you are on a windows system you should be able to install mgl tools in a new directory at this location and with this name exactly "C:\adt" then complete setup for the various systems in mgltools as per your preference, now install this zip and extract it in the following location which should exist if everything is working at this path: "C:\adt\Lib\site packages\AutoDockTools" you should then install Vina and move the vina.exe executable and the vina.split executable into the autodock tools folder.Extract this folder in your program files, move the docking analysis folder into the autodock folder and unpack it by moving the batch scripts to the autodock tools folder, this includes the config file and the enzyme pdbqt. Install your conda environment as per the spec file provided, also ensure your path is conifgured to include the python executable at "C\adt\python.exe" and the entire "C:\adt" directory.

Common troubleshooting fixes:
-Ensure all directories exist at the paths specified in this readme which should match the code
-Ensure all executables and their dependencies are installed in the correct directories
(both of these shouldnt be an issue if you follow the installation protocol)
-Check file permissions, ensure all scripts have full access to read and write files and all users/system have full access to 
-Configure your path to include the Vina.exe executable
